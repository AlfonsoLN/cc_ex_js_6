/* *Instructions*
    You will solve one of the most famous cypher... Caesar's cypher.

    This is a shift cypher meaning that all the letters shift it's position by a set amount.

    You need to implement a cypher that rotates each later exactly 13 positions (using only the English alphabeth),
    as input you will get a coded string and you must return the decoded result.
